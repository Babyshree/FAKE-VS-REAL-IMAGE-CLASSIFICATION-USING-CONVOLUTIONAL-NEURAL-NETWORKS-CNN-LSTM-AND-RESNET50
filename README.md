# Fake Face Image Classification Project
## Overview
This project aims to classify facial images as either "fake" or "real" using deep learning techniques. The dataset consists of facial images that are labeled as either fake or real. We implemented two models for this classification task: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. Additionally, we utilized a pre-trained ResNet50 model for feature extraction.

## Features
CNN Model: A convolutional neural network that processes the raw image data.
LSTM Model: An LSTM network that takes the features extracted by ResNet50 as input.
ResNet50 Feature Extraction: Pre-trained ResNet50 is used to extract features from the images.
Visualization: Training history (loss and accuracy) visualized using matplotlib.
Prediction: Capability to predict the class label of an input image.
